# Add Custom Build to Firefox

Go to the url `about:debugging`.

Click the button `Load Temporary Add-On`.

Select the file `dist/firefox/manifest.json`.

You can optionally enable debugging, and click `Debug`, for a console window that logs all of Metamask's processes to a single console.

If you have problems debugging, try connecting to the IRC channel `#webextensions` on `irc.mozilla.org`.

For longer questions, use the StackOverflow tag `firefox-addons`.
