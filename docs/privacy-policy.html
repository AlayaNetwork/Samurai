        <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;your representatives, advisers and others you have authorised to interact with us on your behalf
        </p>

        <p>In some cases the people to whom we disclose your personal information may be located overseas. Further, we
            may have servers located overseas. The jurisdictions in which these people and/or servers are likely to be

        <p style="margin-top: 2em;"><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
        <p>We use cookies to monitor and observe your use of our websites, compile aggregate data about that use, and
            provide you with a more effective service (which may include customising parts of our websites based on your
            preferences and past activities on those websites). "Cookies" are small text files created and stored on
            your hard drive by your internet browser software, in order to hold relevant information about the web page
            you are currently viewing. Most internet browsers have a facility that will allow you to disable cookies
            altogether – please refer to your browser's help menu to find out how to do this. While you will still be
            able to browse our websites with cookies disabled on your internet browser, some website functionality may
            not be available or may not function correctly.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 2em;"><strong>Storage and security of personal data</strong></p>
        <p>We generally store the personal data that we collect in electronic databases, some of which may be held on
            our behalf by third party data storage providers. Sometimes we also keep hard copy records of this personal
            data in physical storage facilities. We use a range of physical and technical security processes and
            procedures to protect the confidentiality and security of the information that we hold, and we update these
            from time to time to address new and emerging security threats that you become aware of.</p>
        <p>We also take steps to monitor access to and modification of your information by our staff, and ensure that
            our staff are aware of and properly trained in their obligations for managing your privacy.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 2em;"><strong>Retention of personal data</strong></p>
        <p>Your personal data will only be kept as long as required for the purposes for which such personal data was
            collected, held, processed, used and/or disclosed, or for any legal or business purposes.</p>
        <p>We may retain your personal data for a period of up to seven (7) years, or for such longer period if the purpose
            for which that personal data was collected is served by retention of the personal data, and retention is
            necessary for legal or business purposes. At our discretion, we may retain personal data for longer than
            the said period if we consider it necessary or desirable to do so to meet our legal or regulatory obligations.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 2em;"><strong>Access and correction</strong></p>
        <p>If you want to access any of the personal data that we hold about you or to correct some aspect of it (for
            example, because you think it is incomplete or incorrect), please contact our privacy compliance team using
            the contact details set out below. To protect the integrity and security of the information we hold, we may
            ask that you follow a defined access procedure, which may include steps to verify your identity. In certain
            cases we may charge you an administration fee for providing you with access to the information you have
            asked for, but we will inform you of this before proceeding. There may be cases where we are unable to
            provide the information you request, such as where it would interfere with the privacy of others or result
            in a breach of confidentiality. In these cases we will let you know why we cannot comply with your request.
        </p>
        <p>Even if you do not request access to and/or correct your personal data held by us, if we are satisfied that,
            having regard to the reasons for which we hold your personal data, that personal data is inaccurate,
            incomplete, out-of-date, irrelevant or misleading, we may take reasonable steps to correct that information.
