# MetaMask Philosophy

## Mission

Making it safe and easy for the most people to use the decentralized web to the greatest degree that is empowering to them.

## Vision

To realize the highest goals achievable for the human race with the twin powers of peer to peer networks and cryptography. To empower users to hold and use their own keys on these new networks as securely and intelligibly as possible, enabling a new world of peer to peer agreements and economies, in hopes that we may collectively overcome the many great problems that we face together, through the power of strong cooperation.

## Strategy

We provide software for users to manage accounts, for sites to easily propose actions to users, and for users to coherently review actions before approving them. We build on this rapidly evolving set of protocols with the goal of empowering the most people to the greatest degree, and aspire to continuously evolve our offering to pursue that goal.
