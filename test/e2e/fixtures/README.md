# End-to-end tests

This directory contains the fixture data used to bootstrap the individual e2e tests. Each sub-directory contains
one thing:

1. A `state.json` file that represents a the saved state for the extension (see _Generating fixture data_ below)

## Generating fixture data

Fixture data can be generated by following these steps:

1. Load the unpacked extension in development or test mode
2. Inspecting the background context of the extension
3. Call `metamaskGetState`, then call [`copy`][1] on the results

You can then paste the contents directly in your fixture file.

```js
copy(await metamaskGetState())
```
